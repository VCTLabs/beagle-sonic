  We need to switch channels on the analog muxes before we sample,
  and the MAX4734 datasheet says that takes 25ns.

  The AD9201 has 4ns aperture delay.  So we have to wait that long after
  the rising clock edge before we switch.

  The input RC filter (10 ohms + 100pF) has a corner at 160MHz, so a bit
  less than 10ns.  So we should wait at least that long after switching
  so that the filter has had time to respond.  Also, there's almost
  200pF of capacitance inside the MAX4734.

  So we want to switch at least 35ns before we sample, and after we sample
  we shouldnt switch for 4ns.  So one or two PRU clock cycles after the
  rising ADC clock edge, we should be fine to switch, and that maximizes
  the time we have to switch and overcome capacitance before the next
  rising edge.

  Register 30:
  Bit 0: clock
  Bit 5 and 3: channel 0 input select
  Bit 1 and 2: channel 1 input select
