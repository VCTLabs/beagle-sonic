In this method I have planned to use pru for driving prudaq and PWM for wave generation, I have imported dts for prudaq and for pwm, dts already exist in bb which I have uploaded here again.


# Beagle-Sonic Anemometer
GSoC-2017: Create a sonic anemometer using BeagleBoard Black for 2-dimension wind measurement.

Anemometer is a device used for measurement of wind velocity,they can be of different types, for ex. Cup Anemometer is the most widespread and common type, given its long history and simple mechanism.

However, UltraSonic Anemometer are superior than Anemometer using mechnical parts, because it is not affected by environmental conditions.You can find more about it by simple digging across google.

This Repository is under development hence frequent changes are obvious and you can refer wiki https://github.com/thetransformerr/beagle-sonic/wiki for latest development.

Thanks!!
